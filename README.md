# ai_aggression

## Deprecated and not recommended solution. You may still use this mod, but it wasn't updated for any updates from 1.8.6 version of the game. I personally recommend [Skrunky's Aggressive AI](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3386954072&searchtext=ai+aggression) by Skrunky.

## This Victoria 3 mod tries to make AI way more aggressive. Based on [Aggressive AI](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2971828062&searchtext=ai+aggression) by Not Applicable
